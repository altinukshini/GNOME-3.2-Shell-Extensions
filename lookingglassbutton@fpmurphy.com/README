Notice To Packagers
-------------------

Please contact me before packaging this extension.


Purpose
-------

Add button to top panel to toggle LookingGlass on or off.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called lookingglassbutton@fpmurphy.com
should be created. 

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using: 

   gnome-shell-extension-tool -e lookingglassbutton@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

   gnome-shell-extension-tool -d lookingglassbutton@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.

If you exit Looking Glass using the ESCAPE key rather than
the button, then the button is left in an unknown state. This
is not a major problem as all you have to do is double click
on it the next time to get Looking Glass. 



Version:
--------

V1.0   5/27/2011    Initial version for GNOME Shell 3.0

V2.0   11/01/2011   Version for GNOME Shell 3.2


Notes:
------

This version of the extension does NOT work on versions of 
the GNOME Shell < 3.2.

This has only been tested on Fedora 16 and GNOME Shell 3.2.1.

As of the date of the latest version of this extension, there are 
no officially published APIs for the GNOME Shell. This extension 
relies on accessing internal functions and variables which may 
or may not be present in future versions of the GNOME Shell.


Misc:
