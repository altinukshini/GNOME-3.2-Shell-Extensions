Notice to Packagers
-------------------

Please contact me before packaging this extension.

Note that I no longer use the GPL license due to the lack
of safeguards in that licence for author attribution and
copyright notices.

Please do not place this extension on extensions.gnome.org.
Until more controls are put in place to respect copyrights,
I do not want any of my work to be placed on that website.


Purpose
-------

Display current weather conditions and five day forecast.


Installation
------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called weather@fpmurphy.com
should be created. For global use, install the tarball in
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions and unpack.

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the
extension using the supplied extension-tool:

     extension-tool -e weather@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     extension-tool -d weather@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension.

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadata.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.

This extension accesses weather data from World Weather Online

     http://www.worldweatheronline.com/

To use this extension, you must sign up and get a free API key
from World Weather Online.  Sign up is simple and painless.

Once you have an API key, you can configure the extension by right
clicking on the weather icon and entering the API key and location.
Location can either be a string such as TOKYO, DUBLIN, IRELAND, or a 
zipcode such as 01960.

Alternatively you can use the command line weather-tool to customize
the extension. See

    extension-tool --help

for more information.

This version does not support localized message strings. A
future version may do so.

This version of the extension does NOT work on versions of
the GNOME Shell < 3.2.

This has only been tested on Fedora 16 and GNOME Shell 3.2.

relies on an internal structures which may or may not be present
