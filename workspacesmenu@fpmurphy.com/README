Notice To Packagers
-------------------

Please contact me before packaging this extension.


Purpose:
--------

Create and manage (hide or show) a workspaces menu on the RHS 
of the top panel.


Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called workspacesmenu@fpmurphy.com
should be created. It can also be installed globally at 
/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions.

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and enable the 
extension using: 

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -e workspacesmenu@fpmurphy.com

To disable the extension:

     gnome-shell-extension-tool -d workspacesmenu@fpmurphy.com

Other tools such as gnome-tweak-tool can also be used to
enable or disable the extension. 

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.


Version:
--------

v1.0   5/1/2011    Initial version for GNOME 3.0 

v2.0   11/05/2011  Initial version for GNOME 3.2


Notes:
------

This version of the extension does NOT work on versions of 
the GNOME Shell < 3.2.

This has only been tested on Fedora 16 and GNOME Shell 3.2.1.

As of the date of the latest version of this extension, there are 
no officially published APIs for the GNOME Shell. This extension 
relies on internal structures and variables which may or may 
not be present in future versions of the GNOME Shell.


Misc:
-----

The latest version of my GNOME Shell extensions can always be 
found at:
